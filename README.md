# frontend-nanodegree-neighbourhood-map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.

You will then add additional functionality to this application, 
including: 
1. Map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit.
1. A search function to easily discover these locations.
1. A listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 

You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations
(such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
